# Discworld Adventure Story Requirements

## Setting and Location
- **Primary Location**: Ankh-Morpork, the greatest city on the Disc
- **Specific Areas**: The Shades (dangerous district), Unseen University, the Watch House on Pseudopolis Yard, and the Post Office
- **Time Period**: Present-day Discworld (after the events of Going Postal, but before Raising Steam)

## Main Character
- **Protagonist**: A new arrival to Ankh-Morpork - perhaps a young person seeking their fortune or someone with a mysterious past
- **Starting Situation**: The player character has just arrived in the city with little money and needs to find work and lodging
- **Goal**: Help solve a peculiar mystery that threatens the city's postal system and the clacks network

## Core Mystery/Plot
The story revolves around mysterious disruptions to the clacks (semaphore) system that are causing messages to arrive scrambled, delayed, or containing strange additional content. Some messages seem to be predicting future events, while others contain cryptic warnings. The Smoking Gnu (underground clacks operators) suspect supernatural interference, but Commander Vimes thinks it's sabotage.

## Key NPCs to Include
- **Moist von Lipwig**: Head of the Post Office, charming conman turned civic hero
- **Commander Sam Vimes**: Head of the City Watch, cynical but honest copper
- **Lord Vetinari**: The Patrician, always several steps ahead of everyone
- **Adora Belle Dearheart**: Moist's chain-smoking love interest, expert on the clacks
- **The Librarian**: The orangutan librarian of Unseen University
- **A member of the Smoking Gnu**: Underground clacks operator with insider knowledge

## Story Branches and Choices
The adventure should include at least 3 major branching paths:

1. **The Watch Path**: Work with Commander Vimes to investigate sabotage
2. **The Post Office Path**: Help Moist von Lipwig trace the source through postal records  
3. **The University Path**: Consult the wizards about possible magical interference

Each path should offer 2-3 choices at key decision points, leading to different discoveries and encounters.

## Tone and Style Requirements
- **Humor**: Include clever wordplay, puns, and absurd situations treated seriously
- **Footnotes**: Add at least 3-5 footnotes with additional jokes or world-building details
- **Running Gags**: Reference classic Discworld elements (million-to-one chances, etc.)
- **Social Commentary**: Subtly explore themes of communication, truth, and bureaucracy
- **Character Voice**: Each NPC should have distinct speech patterns and personality

## Technical Requirements
- **Length**: 8-12 story steps with multiple choices per step
- **Endings**: Include at least 3 different endings (success, partial success, humorous failure)
- **Inventory**: Include simple inventory system (money, clacks equipment, official papers)
- **Variables**: Track reputation with different factions (Watch, Post Office, University)

## Specific Discworld Elements to Include
- References to the clacks system and semaphore towers
- The importance of getting mail delivered ("Neither rain nor snow nor glom of nit...")
- Ankh-Morpork's unique blend of ancient and modern technology
- The city's practical approach to magic and supernatural events
- The complex relationship between official authority and street-level reality

## Victory Conditions
The adventure succeeds when the player:
- Discovers the true source of the clacks disruption
- Helps restore normal communication to the city
- Gains the respect of at least one major faction
- Solves the mystery in a way that feels satisfyingly Discworld-esque (clever, humorous, and slightly subversive)

The story should feel like a genuine Discworld tale - funny, clever, and ultimately optimistic about human nature despite acknowledging human flaws.
