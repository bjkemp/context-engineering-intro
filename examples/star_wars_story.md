Write a story referencing the following summary, things to include, and criteria:

Summary:
The timeperiod is the Old Republic. The reader is a young Republic pilot who has joined an elite pilot squadron called the Black Hawks. The begins  begin at the pinning ceremony, where the reader receives their wings, signifying their advancement to pilot. Everything is going as planned, when the ceremony is interrupted by air-raid alarm blaring and the shudder of an aerial bombing run. The reader is now on their first mission: A squadron of separatist fighters have begun attacking the airbase. The reader needs to think quick and get to their fighter before all is lost. A high-octane air battle ensues, where the reader engages in dog-fights, ending with a head-to-head battle with the Separtist squadron commander. If the reader succeeds, they return to base and the real adventure begins. If they don't succeed, the reader awakes from a daydream and the story picks back up with the reader sitting with their fellow cadets at the pinning ceremony.

The main adventure in this story should focus on the recovery of a prototype interstellar torpedo capable of being launched through hyperspace. A special launch system and the prototype were stolen during the earlier air-raid, which served as a distraction. If this weapon were to fall into the wrong hands, all hope for peace in the galaxy would be lost and the reader, who we discover is force sensitive, is the only one that can recover the weapon. The reader, along with select members of the Black Hawk squadron, embark on a journey full of twists, turns, puzzles, and adventure.

The main adventure should include:

1) A barely functioning droid companion named K4-N2. K4 serves as a funny, but important character, giving the reader a sense of direction and advice that ultimately leads the reader to the recovery of the stolen weapon system.
2) Run-ins with galactic bad-guys including a reoccuring bounty hunter sent by a separtist gang leader, a gravity well, and summa-verminoth
3) Puzzles, droids, and artifacts left from the Dawn of the Jedi era, which occurs around 25,000 BBY


Follow these criteria:

1) The name of this story should be "The Black Hawks: Troubles in Hyperspace"
2) The story should be written in the 2nd person (e.g. you). Set the [NAME] parameter to false.
3) Advanced Parameters, other than the [ENDINGS], are not needed for this story.
4) Keep each step of the narrative between 4 to 6 sentences.
5) Limit the length of the story so that the reader follows at around 500 steps before arriving at the end and limit the choices to 2 to 3 per step.
6) Make sure that each choice leads to another step in the story. Do not have incomplete steps.
7) Design the choices in a way that ultimately converge to an ending concludes with [ENDING_SUCCESS] or [ENDING_FAILURE]. 
8) If the reader perrishes (e.g. is eaten by a monster, gets sucked into a gravity well, crash lands their starship), the next step in the story should describe the reader waking up from a dream to find themselves a few steps before the tragidy occured, so the reader can choose a path that doesn't result in their demise.
9) Format your output in plain text and adhere to the directions of the parameters file. Do not use standard markdown.
