## Story Summary
The timeperiod is the Old Republic. The reader is a young Republic pilot who has joined an elite pilot squadron called the Black Hawks. The begins begin at the pinning ceremony, where the reader receives their wings, signifying their advancement to pilot. Everything is going as planned, when the ceremony is interrupted by air-raid alarm blaring and the shudder of an aerial bombing run. The reader is now on their first mission: A squadron of separatist fighters have begun attacking the airbase. The reader needs to think quick and get to their fighter before all is lost. A high-octane air battle ensues, where the reader engages in dog-fights, ending with a head-to-head battle with the Separtist squadron commander. If the reader succeeds, they return to base and the real adventure begins. If they don't succeed, the reader awakes from a daydream and the story picks back up with the reader sitting with their fellow cadets at the pinning ceremony.

## Main Adventure Plot
The main adventure in this story should focus on the recovery of a prototype interstellar torpedo capable of being launched through hyperspace. A special launch system and the prototype were stolen during the earlier air-raid, which served as a distraction. If this weapon were to fall into the wrong hands, all hope for peace in the galaxy would be lost and the reader, who we discover is force sensitive, is the only one that can recover the weapon. The reader, along with select members of the Black Hawk squadron, embark on a journey full of twists, turns, puzzles, and adventure.

## Required Story Elements

### Key Characters
1) **K4-N2 (K4)**: A barely functioning droid companion. K4 serves as a funny, but important character, giving the reader a sense of direction and advice that ultimately leads the reader to the recovery of the stolen weapon system.

### Encounters and Obstacles
2) Run-ins with galactic bad-guys including:
   - A reoccuring bounty hunter sent by a separatist gang leader
   - A gravity well encounter
   - Summa-verminoth (space creature)

### Ancient Elements
3) Puzzles, droids, and artifacts left from the Dawn of the Jedi era, which occurs around 25,000 BBY

## Story Formatting Criteria

### Basic Parameters
1) **Title**: "The Black Hawks: Troubles in Hyperspace"
2) **Perspective**: Written in 2nd person (e.g. "you"). Set the [NAME] parameter to false.
3) **Advanced Parameters**: Other than the [ENDINGS], are not needed for this story.

### Structure Requirements
4) **Narrative Length**: Keep each step of the narrative between 4 to 6 sentences.

### Death and Revival Mechanic
9) **Dream Sequence**: If the reader perishes (e.g. is eaten by a monster, gets sucked into a gravity well, crash lands their starship), the next step in the story should describe the reader waking up from a dream to find themselves a few steps before the tragedy occurred, so the reader can choose a path that doesn't result in their demise.
